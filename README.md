## Description

The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning 
only left or right by ninety degrees until you manage to eat an apple.

When the Snake gets the apple, the Snake grows an extra block or body 
segment.

When the Snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats 
himself the game is over. The more apples the snake eats the higher 
the score.
